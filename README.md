Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Address and correct any inconsistencies in the dataset.
Handling Missing Values: Apply appropriate techniques to  remove missing data.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features to ensure they contribute equally to the analysis.
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Dimensionality Reduction: Utilize PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining the majority of the variance. This step will help in identifying key features influencing customer behavior.
3. Agglomerative Clustering
Clustering: Apply agglomerative clustering on the PCA-reduced dataset.
Linkage Methods: Experiment with various linkage methods such as Ward, Complete, and Average.
Distance Metrics: Explore different distance metrics to determine the most suitable for your data.
Optimal Clusters: Use techniques like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to identify the optimal number of clusters.
4. Results Analysis
Cluster Characterization: Analyze and describe each cluster based on the original features.
Insights: Provide actionable insights into the distinct customer segments identified through clustering.
