Approach:

Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize/standardize the features.


Apply PCA:

Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.
This step will help in identifying the most important features that contribute to customer behavior.


Agglomerative Clustering:

Apply agglomerative clustering to the reduced dataset from PCA.
Experiment with different linkage methods (e.g., Ward, complete, average) and distance metrics.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette score.


Analyze Results:

Characterize each cluster based on the original features.
Provide insights into the distinct customer segments identified.
